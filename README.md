# Adaptive-Wing-Loss-for-Face-Alignment
This is a partial implementation of the paper "Adaptive Wing Loss for Robust Face Alignment via Heatmap Regression" in Tensorflow. 

Some components have yet to be added, including boundary prediction and coordinate aggregation. 

The current trained model is not included due to file size limitations.
